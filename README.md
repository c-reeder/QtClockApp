# QtClockApp
A Qt Desktop Application which provides a clock, timer, stopwatch, and alarms.


This project is not intended to be anything impressive. I simply find all of the currently available clock apps for KDE Plasma to be a bit lacking. So I have decided to make one. I currently only plan for it to have the basic 4 functionalities: Clock, Timer, Stopwatch, and Alarms.

I haven't spent a lot of time developing in C++ and I've never used Qt before, so it will be a good learning experience in both for me.
